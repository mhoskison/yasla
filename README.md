# YASLA
#### Yet Another Shopping List App

### Introduction
YASLA is a mobile-first shopping list app built with Angular Material and AngularJS 
for the UI, and Laravel 5.6 for the API. It comes in two flavours, both built from an identical
codebase:

* Web app: https://app.yasla.co.uk
* Android app: https://app.yasla.co.uk/yasla.apk 

The app integrates with the Tesco Groceries API for instant lookup of pricing and availability, 
but you can also add your own freetext items.

YASLA is still undergoing active development and has just reached V0.1. 
Don't expect it to revolutionise your shopping experience ... just yet!
